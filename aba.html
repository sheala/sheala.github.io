	      <p>Baer, Wolf and Risley described Applied Behaviour Analysis as the science in
which socially important behaviours are changed using a technology based on the
principals of behaviour and experimentation. It includes the identification of a functional
relationship between the behaviour and the environment, and interventions
based on the functional assessment and empirically supported techniques which create
antecedent strategies, teach replacement skills and attempt to change the reinforcement
contingencies.</p><p> Applied Behaviour Analysis prides itself in solving socially important
problems and has produced powerful interventions in fields such as autism,
developmental disabilities, education, clinical psychology, and organizational behaviour
management.
