      </div>
                   <p>Our development of the tutorial, Combining Toolboxes, will strongly impact all major players in persuasive technology design through combining the most powerful tools of each discipline to analyze and design solutions for a specific target challenge.</p> 
	<p>Combining Toolboxes will offer unique insight into theories, methodologies, and design perspectives unique to the fields of engineering and behavioural analysts, and how each disciplineâ€™s tools can be transferred across disciplines to build powerful and uniquely innovative solutions in persuasive technology. Participants of the Combining Toolboxes tutorial will come away with a detailed concept map of an inter-disciplinary approach to a target challenge.</p>
